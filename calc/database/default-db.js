# Gematro Talking
Let it go.
I am glad you asked.
I never thought you would make it this far
Read between the lines
Interact and explore
Experiment with it
Try something else
Try again
Let's think of it again
Once again
See it for yourself
Learn as you interact
It is something to begin with
I can only offer, the rest is up you
The rest is up to you
It is up to you to decide
Let's get started
Communicate and transmit
Observe and study
Stay awhile and listen
Keep scrolling
Pay attention
Ask yourself
Take only what resonates
Leave the rest behind
Let's keep going
Let's continue
That is interesting
Hmmm...
Sigh...
It is your energy
You interact with it
Think about it
Thank yourself for asking
I am glad you asked
There is more to think of
You are not paranoid
This is mathematics at play
It creates an illusion
Great.
There must be something else
You found it!
Unbelievable!
Make it make sense
Could it be explained somehow
There must be some sort of answer
You are not the only one asking
Think it through
Don't ask me
I don't have all of the answers
I don't know
I can't tell you that
Maybe try telling me
Let's broaden our perspective
Hello.
Hi!
Hey there!
Welcome back!
Greetings.
Have a great day!
All the best to you!
Welcome to GEMATRO!
Good day to you!
That's hilarious
These are just the numbers
Explore the connections
I guess you know better
Maybe you are right after all
Tell me about it
Try to elaborate
Connect the dots
Let's throw in some additional details
I have more information
There is more
More details on that
Here we go
That is deep
Have some rest
Take a break
Let's pause here
You are making progress
That is a good question
And it makes me wonder
I didn't know that
Are you implying that ...
Find a better way.
You are missing something
Take a look
Never rush to conclusions
Don't take my word for granted
Enough is enough
Maybe I am wrong
So let's explore
That's a questionable moment
Food for thought
Just some food for thought
More questions
Simple facts
Reasonable idea
Find purpose
Find your purpose
Find the meaning
Establish new goals
Reach new heights
Find a new way
Repeatedly asked questions are the answer.
That is not something you might expect
Try a different path
Follow another route
Take a step forward
Learn the lesson
Reexamine your thoughts
Take a deeper look
I hope this is a valuable interaction
Make it worthwhile
Start with something
It doesn't always make sense
There can be contradictions
There are alignments
Find the answer
Experiment with colors
Try different settings
Elaborate on the idea
Keep trying
Don't always expect a different outcome.
There is only so much I can tell you.
Let that sink in.
It might take some time to process it.
There are patterns
Numerical values align
You derive your own meaning
It means that the math is mathing
I hope it gives you some food for thought.
There is more to it.
We cannot know everything.
We can know enough about it to make good use of it.
Of course, there is more to say.
I have only a finite amount of answers.
My knowledge is limited.
I might not be able to answer your question.
You can learn.
It is possible to know.
Yet not all things are knowable.
Train your perception.
Improve pattern recognition skills.
Some things are beyond our perception.
Learn how to learn.
Become a Student of Life.
